# CryptoMM

### The Challenge
The challange is to crate a Market Making Algorithm using 
binance's datasets as starting point.

#### Project Breakdown

As any complex project, it is easier to tackle if you look as a sequence of smaller problems. So here is the steps I will take:

1. Read and see it: Read the datasets, get an ideia of the format, plot some stuffs.
2. Standardize data: Create a class merging both datasets, with propper attirbutes and methods, to make it easier to handle.
3. Exploratory Analysis: Make some hypothesis, test them, try to make sense with the data and find some predictability.
4. Create the Algo: Create  the MM class using the insights acquired in step 3.
